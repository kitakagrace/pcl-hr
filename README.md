rep management system

THIS system was created in simple php, javascript, css and bootstrap.

NOTICE: "FRAMEWORKS ARE OVER RATED"

File Structure is simply seen 

As for php sessions for login i have required the sessionLogger php script into the navbar php script since the navbar is required everywhere in both reps and staff page.
